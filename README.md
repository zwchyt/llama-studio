Hexllama is a fast, native desktop interface designed to streamline managing and running local Large Language Models using llama.cpp. It strips away the friction of command-line execution and manual file management, providing a unified workspace to discover, download, configure, and serve models.

Built by and for local AI enthusiasts, Hexllama ensures you spend less time wrestling with terminal arguments and more time interacting with models.

## Features

**Integrated Model Hub**
Search Hugging Face directly within the application. Browse repositories, view file details, and download GGUF models with a single click without ever opening a browser.

**Smart Download Manager**
Pause, resume, or cancel large model downloads reliably. You can also paste direct GGUF links. When a download completes, Hexllama automatically generates an execution template with recommended threads, batch sizes, and context windows tailored to the model's parameters and quantization level.

**Template-Based Execution**
Save your configurations as reusable templates. Run multiple models simultaneously on different ports without conflict. Launch them in "Chat UI" mode to automatically open the built-in llama.cpp web interface, or "API Only" mode to serve them silently in the background.

**Version and Backend Management**
Running cutting-edge models sometimes requires different builds of llama.cpp. Hexllama lets you maintain and seamlessly switch between multiple backend binaries. It automatically checks the ggml-org repository for new releases and lets you download and extract them straight from the settings panel.

**Visual Command Editor**
Stop memorizing execution flags. Edit backend-specific commands through a structured user interface. Toggle booleans, set limits on numerical inputs, and define default parameter values for the llama.cpp server.
